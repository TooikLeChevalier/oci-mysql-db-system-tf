# oci-mysql-db-system-tf

This project contains a set of scripts to be used with the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Resource Manager. These scripts can be deployed as a 'stack' that will create a MySQL DB System, fully confgured Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) and an optional bastion host compute instance that can be used for network connectivity to the MySQL DB.

For more information, please see: [TODO: add blog post link].
